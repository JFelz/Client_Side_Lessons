[MUST WATCH: Walkthrough Video]()

FIRST, let us acknowledge that this may seem like a lot to learn, but you will do this so many times, it will become second nature to you...remember to TRUST THE PROCESS. I gotchu, fam!

When you are working on assignments and teams, you will sometimes need to clone a repo so that you can get to work. You will only clone a repo if there is already code on GitHub that you do not already have on your local machine.

In this lesson, we will be sharing how to do that.

Back on your local machine, navigate to the directory that you want this repo to live (i.e. cd ~/workspace/foundations/clone

1. Visit another users repo

2. Click on the green dropdown menu that says "Code" and copy the SSH URL.

3. cd into the new directory that was created

4. Clone the repo using this command: git clone {{CHANGE TO GITHUB SSH URL YOU HAVE COPIED}}

5. run code . to view the code on your local machine

6. run http-server -o to test the code locally

7. YOU DID IT!
